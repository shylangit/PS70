<h3>Week 8: CNC Milling</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>

<p> For this week's assignment, I wanted to make a functional design. I landed on making a jewelry tray.
  My inspiration for this week was an organic design. I went with a koi pond design.
</p>
<p> To create this project, I first modeled my design on Fusion.</p>

<p> To do this, I drew the the shape of the pond, and then imported vector images of the koi fish onto my sketch. After, I 
  drew the other elements of the pond using Fusion's sketch tools. 
</p>
<p> Next, I loaded my design into the CNC software and prepared it to be cut. After doing so, I noticed some issues with
  extra lines on vector image fish, so, I went back and cleaned up my Fusion sketch.

<p> Reflections: </p>
<p> Overall, I was happy with how the pond came out. I liked how the wood layering allowed for the water to be a different color 
  then the other elements in the design. In future iterations, I would probably scale the internal elements in the pond up a 
  little to allow them to cut a little cleaner (especially the water ripples, which I ended up sanding off) and smooth some of 
  the edges on the fin/tail design. I would also like to add more elements into the pond. </p>

<h4>Molding and Casting</h4>
<p> For the molding and casting portion of this week, I decided to 3D print my cat scan from week 5 and make a mold of it. </p>

<p> I decided to use vacuum forming to create a mold of the cat, and then I used plaster to cast it. </p>

<p> Here is the finished plaster cat! </p>
