<h3>Final Project: Moving Table </h3>
<h4>Progress: </h4>
<p>Since getting the table prototype built and moving, I've added two new features to the table. </p>

<img src="table_p2.jpg" alt="table p2" style="width:500px" /> 
<p class="margin"> </p>

<ol>
  <li>Camera</li>
  <p> The first thing I added to the table was a live camera feed. I used the ESP32 CAM and set up the live feed 
    via web server. The device streaming the feed must be connected to the same Wifi server as the ESP32. Now,
    we can see where the table is moving and control it out of our line of sight.
  </p>
  <li>Updated Controls</li>
  <p> Previously, the table was controlled by WASD keyboard input. While this was a good star to get things moving, 
    this control system would force you to bring your laptop with you if you wanted to use the table. This would 
    kinda defeat the point of the table since you wouldn't be able to keep your hands free.
  </p>
  <p> After networking week, I realized I could use the MPU-6050 gyro/accelerometer to control the movement of the
    table. This way, the table could really "follow" you without needing a literal remote control. To implement the 
    new control system, I adapted our gyro code for turret head movement to instead translate gyro tilt data into
    movement instructions for the motors (forward, backward, left, right). This way, I only had to update the controller
    ESP32 code.
  </p>
  <p> Now, when you tilt the gyro, the table will move accordingly (tilt forward, move forward, etc.)</p>
</ol>

<h4>Debugging:</h4>
<p>I'm still having an issue with one of the wheels refusing to move, even after individually replacing each piece
  of hardware and checking the software. I'll have to take a look at it again. Also, I somehow managed to flip the 
  directionality of left/right tilt orientation, but that should be a quick fix.
</p>


<h4>Next steps:</h4>
<p>In my next iteration of my final project, I would like to implement the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speed control using the accelerometer - adjust the speed of the table based on the acceleration recorded
    by the accelerometer on the MPU-6050.
  </li>
  <li>Wearable control - attach the MPU-6050 to something like a glove or bracelet that can be worn on the arm
    so that the table can really follow the user around.
  </li>
  <li>Cleaner web server - customize the web server UI that is streaming the live feed from the ESP32 cam.</li>
  <li>Add. features - other fun features for the table. Looking for suggestions! </li>
</ul>
