<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h4>

<p>This week, were assigned to model and 3D print something. My original idea was to print out little jumping frogs, like these: </p>
<img src="plastic_frogs.jpeg" style="width:250px" />

<p>After modeling my design on Fusion, I printed my first iteration. Ultimately, the legs were too thin and would break off while
  I tried to remove the support material. Additionally, the tab used to push down would not bend as needed.
</p>
<p>I ended up going through a few iterations before I switched ideas. After these iterations, I realized PLA is probably not
  the best material for this design. If I really had to try to make it work though, I would probably scale the design up 
  more and attempt to design a better hinge that can bend and (hopefully) generate the kinetic energy needed to make the frog
  jump.

  <p> I went through a couple of iterations varying the thickness of the legs and body of the frog.</p>

<p>Impulsive pivot: </p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to pivot to attempt to make an articulate design. I was interested in designing something that had 
  some movment capability. I landed on making a chain-link PIP dratini. 
</p>

<p> This model turned out to be more of a proof-of-concept. The CADing can definitely be improved on and some
  paint would certainly help! I would like to look into better using t-splines as well to get more organic
  shapes for the design. The model does articulate though!
