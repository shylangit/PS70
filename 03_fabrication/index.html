<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

<p> Drafting </p>
<p> For this week's assignment, I had several ideas: </p>
<ul> 
  <li> Boat/ocean </li>
  <li> Flying Pokemon </li>
  <li> Ferris wheel </li>
</ul>

<p> I decided to make the ferris wheel! </p>

<p> Step 1: Sketching </p>
<p> To start my design process, I began by hand-sketching some ideas and design for the ferris wheel. After some rough 
  idea drawing, I translated my sketch to Fusion and made some adjustments.
</p>

<p> Step 2: Prototyping </p>
<p> Before I cut out my design, I first made a smaller prototype to play around with the spinning mechanism. I sketched and 
  cut out a smaller 6-inch circle, an attachment for the motor, and some temporary legs for the wheel. I decided
  to use a gear motor to spin my ferris wheel, since the spinning part isn't a circle, so it would be easier to get it to
  spin my structure.
</p>
<p> After cutting out my pieces, I got the protoype spinning with the motor. I made some slight adjustments along
  the way to the dimensions of the motor attachment so it would better fit the shape of the motor.
</p>

<p> Step 3: Wheel Construction </p>
<p> After making my prototype spin, I made some minor adjustments to the dimensions of my full sketch on Fusion accordingly.
  Once ready, I cut the parts for my ferris wheel in the laser cutter. 
</p>
<p> Afterwards, I started assembling the pieces of my ferris wheel together. This is where I ran into most of my 
  design problems. I had some issues with aligning the spinning rod properly after assembling the legs. There were also some
  slight issues with the motor slipping out of the motor attachment. 
</p>

<p> Final Product: </p>

<p> Improvements: </p>
<p> For the next iteration of this project, these are the changes I would like to make: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Adjust dimensions of cardboard legs to better account for the thickness of the cardboard. </li>
  <li> Figure out a way to make the motor stay in the motor mount better. </li>
  <li> Be more precise while assembling the structure to ensure proper alignment of pieces. </li>
</ul>
